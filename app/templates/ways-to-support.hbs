      <h2>Create a <span>Facebook fundraiser</span> for NaNoWriMo.</h2>
      <p>National Novel Writing Month uses Facebook as its participant fundraising platform. We chose it for two reasons:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If you already use Facebook, set-up is quick and seamless. (AKA, one less service to sign up for!)
        </li>
        <li>
          You'll be able to reach your friends and family where they already are.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you have any questions about fundraising via Facebook, please contact us via the link in the footer.</p>
